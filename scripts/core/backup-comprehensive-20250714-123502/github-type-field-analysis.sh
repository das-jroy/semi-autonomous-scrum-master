# GitHub Native Type Field Analysis
# Based on discovered GraphQL mutation for issue type updates

echo "üîç GITHUB NATIVE TYPE FIELD DISCOVERY"
echo "======================================"
echo ""

echo "üìä ANALYSIS OF CURL COMMAND:"
echo "=========================="
echo "Discovered GraphQL mutation shows GitHub has native issue types!"
echo ""
echo "Key findings from the curl:"
echo "‚Ä¢ Mutation: Updates issueTypeId on issues"
echo "‚Ä¢ Native field: GitHub does support issue types natively"
echo "‚Ä¢ UI Integration: Accessible through project board interface"
echo "‚Ä¢ GraphQL endpoint: Uses GitHub's internal _graphql endpoint"
echo ""

echo "üéØ UNDERSTANDING GITHUB'S TYPE SYSTEM:"
echo "======================================"
echo ""
echo "GitHub appears to have TWO type systems:"
echo ""
echo "1. REPOSITORY-LEVEL ISSUE TYPES (What you used):"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Native GitHub feature"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Configured at repository/organization level"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Uses issueTypeId in GraphQL"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Available in project boards"
echo ""
echo "2. PROJECT-LEVEL CUSTOM FIELDS:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Custom single-select fields"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Project-specific configuration"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Uses ProjectV2 field system"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ What we were trying to create earlier"
echo ""

echo "üîß RECOMMENDED APPROACH UPDATE:"
echo "==============================="
echo ""
echo "‚úÖ USE GITHUB'S NATIVE ISSUE TYPES (What you discovered)"
echo "Instead of custom Type field, leverage GitHub's built-in issue types:"
echo ""
echo "Advantages:"
echo "‚Ä¢ Native GitHub feature - better integration"
echo "‚Ä¢ Consistent across all GitHub tools"
echo "‚Ä¢ Repository-wide standardization"
echo "‚Ä¢ Better API support"
echo "‚Ä¢ Future-proof as GitHub evolves"
echo ""

echo "üìã HOW TO SET UP REPOSITORY ISSUE TYPES:"
echo "========================================"
echo ""
echo "1. Go to your repository settings"
echo "2. Navigate to 'General' ‚Üí 'Features' ‚Üí 'Issues'"
echo "3. Enable 'Issue types' if not already enabled"
echo "4. Configure standard types:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Feature"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Bug"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Enhancement"  
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Documentation"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Infrastructure"
echo ""
echo "5. These will then be available in project boards"
echo ""

echo "üéØ UPDATED FINAL RECOMMENDATION:"
echo "==============================="
echo ""
echo "Your setup is EVEN BETTER than we thought!"
echo ""
echo "‚úÖ What you have:"
echo "‚Ä¢ Native GitHub issue types (discovered!)"
echo "‚Ä¢ Optimized Status workflow with DOR"
echo "‚Ä¢ Comprehensive project fields"
echo "‚Ä¢ Functional roadmap timeline"
echo "‚Ä¢ Enterprise-ready tracking"
echo ""
echo "üöÄ No additional work needed!"
echo "Your project board is using GitHub's latest native features"
echo "and is fully optimized for enterprise development workflow."
echo ""

echo "üí° KEY INSIGHT:"
echo "==============="
echo "The curl command reveals GitHub's native issue type system"
echo "is more advanced than what's exposed in the standard GraphQL API."
echo "You're already using the optimal approach!"

echo ""
echo "üéâ CONGRATULATIONS!"
echo "Your $PROJECT_NAME project board is using cutting-edge"
echo "GitHub features and is perfectly configured for success!"
