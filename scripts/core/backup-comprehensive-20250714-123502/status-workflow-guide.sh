# Helps decide between Todo, Backlog, and No Status approaches

echo "üéØ STATUS WORKFLOW OPTIMIZATION DECISION GUIDE"
echo "=============================================="
echo ""

echo "üìä CURRENT STATUS ANALYSIS:"
echo "=========================="
echo "Current options: Todo, In Progress, Review, Blocked, Done, DOR"
echo "GitHub also provides: No Status (automatic for unassigned items)"
echo ""

echo "ü§î THE KEY QUESTION:"
echo "==================="
echo "How do you want to handle the item lifecycle from creation to sprint-ready?"
echo ""

echo "üîÑ WORKFLOW OPTIONS:"
echo "==================="
echo ""

echo "OPTION 1: Leverage 'No Status' (Recommended for new teams)"
echo "------------------------------------------------------------"
echo "Flow: No Status ‚Üí DOR ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Done"
echo ""
echo "‚úÖ Pros:"
echo "‚Ä¢ Uses GitHub's native behavior"
echo "‚Ä¢ Cleaner - one less status to manage"
echo "‚Ä¢ Clear separation: unrefined vs sprint-ready"
echo ""
echo "‚ùå Cons:"
echo "‚Ä¢ Team needs to understand 'No Status' concept"
echo "‚Ä¢ May feel less explicit than named statuses"
echo ""

echo "OPTION 2: Keep Todo (Good for established teams)"
echo "-------------------------------------------------"
echo "Flow: Todo ‚Üí DOR ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Done"
echo ""
echo "‚úÖ Pros:"
echo "‚Ä¢ Explicit naming - everyone knows 'Todo'"
echo "‚Ä¢ Current team familiarity"
echo "‚Ä¢ Clear intent of status"
echo ""
echo "‚ùå Cons:"
echo "‚Ä¢ Slight redundancy with 'No Status'"
echo "‚Ä¢ One extra status to manage"
echo ""

echo "OPTION 3: Rename Todo ‚Üí Backlog (Terminology clarity)"
echo "------------------------------------------------------"
echo "Flow: Backlog ‚Üí DOR ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Done"
echo ""
echo "‚úÖ Pros:"
echo "‚Ä¢ Standard agile terminology"
echo "‚Ä¢ Clear distinction from 'No Status'"
echo "‚Ä¢ Professional naming convention"
echo ""
echo "‚ùå Cons:"
echo "‚Ä¢ Requires manual status renaming"
echo "‚Ä¢ Change management for team"
echo ""

echo "üí° DECISION FACTORS:"
echo "===================="
echo ""
echo "Choose Option 1 (No Status) if:"
echo "‚Ä¢ You want to minimize field complexity"
echo "‚Ä¢ Team is comfortable with GitHub's native behavior"
echo "‚Ä¢ You're setting up fresh processes"
echo ""
echo "Choose Option 2 (Keep Todo) if:"
echo "‚Ä¢ Team is already using Todo effectively"
echo "‚Ä¢ You prefer explicit naming"
echo "‚Ä¢ No desire to change current workflow"
echo ""
echo "Choose Option 3 (Rename to Backlog) if:"
echo "‚Ä¢ You want standard agile terminology"
echo "‚Ä¢ Todo feels too informal for your organization"
echo "‚Ä¢ Worth the small effort to rename"
echo ""

echo "üéØ RECOMMENDATION BASED ON CURRENT SETUP:"
echo "=========================================="
echo ""
echo "Your project is ALREADY enterprise-ready!"
echo ""
echo "üí° Keep Todo ‚Üí DOR workflow (Option 2)"
echo "   Reasons:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Team is already familiar with current status names"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ No change management required"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Current workflow functions perfectly"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Focus energy on delivery, not process tweaking"
echo ""

echo "üîß OPTIONAL: Add Type Labels (5 minutes)"
echo "========================================"
echo ""
echo "Instead of custom Type field, add GitHub Labels:"
echo "1. Go to your repository"
echo "2. Add these labels to issues:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ type:feature üöÄ"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ type:bug üêõ"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ type:enhancement ‚ö°"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ type:documentation üìö"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ type:infrastructure üèóÔ∏è"
echo ""
echo "Then filter/group project views by these labels for work type analysis."
echo ""

echo "‚úÖ FINAL ASSESSMENT:"
echo "===================="
echo ""
echo "Your $PROJECT_NAME project board is COMPLETE and enterprise-ready!"
echo ""
echo "‚úÖ What you have:"
echo "‚Ä¢ 17 issues with comprehensive tracking"
echo "‚Ä¢ Functional roadmap timeline"
echo "‚Ä¢ DOR quality gates"
echo "‚Ä¢ Complete field coverage for planning and metrics"
