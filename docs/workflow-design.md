# Semi-Autonomous Scrum Master - Workflow Design

## Overview

This document outlines the design for a truly generic, object-oriented semi-autonomous scrum master that leverages **GitHub Copilot as the intelligent core** while using enterprise design patterns as the structural framework.

## Core Architecture Principle

üß† **GitHub Copilot = Scrum Master Brain**  
üèóÔ∏è **Design Patterns = Structural Framework**  
‚ö° **GitHub Actions = Execution Environment**

The system works by having GitHub Copilot perform all the cognitive tasks that a human scrum master would do (writing user stories, creating acceptance criteria, estimating story points, planning sprints, conducting retrospectives), while design patterns provide the reliable, structured framework for these operations.

## High-Level Architecture

**Advantages**:
- Clean separation of concerns
- Can manage multiple target repositories
- Easier to maintain and update
- No pollution of target repository

### Mode 2: Embedded Integration

See: [Deployment Mode 2 Diagram](diagrams/deployment-mode-2.mmd)

**Advantages**:
- Everything in one place
- Tighter integration
- Immediate access to repo context

## Implementation Priority

## Technology Stack Recommendation

### Core Framework
- **Language**: TypeScript (for strong typing and GitHub ecosystem)
- **Runtime**: Node.js (for GitHub Actions compatibility)
- **Framework**: NestJS (for enterprise-grade architecture patterns)

### Key Dependencies
- **GitHub Integration**: `@octokit/rest`, `@octokit/graphql`
- **Copilot Integration**: GitHub Copilot API, OpenAI API (for Chat completions)
- **Documentation Parsing**: `gray-matter`, `markdown-it`
- **AI/ML**: `@xenova/transformers` (for additional text analysis)
- **Testing**: Jest, supertest
- **Validation**: class-validator, class-transformer

### Design Patterns (Enhanced with Copilot)
- **Strategy Pattern**: Different Copilot strategies for different project types (web, mobile, api, etc.)
- **Factory Pattern**: Creating appropriate Copilot-enhanced analyzers and generators
- **Observer Pattern**: Copilot-powered progress monitoring and intelligent notifications
- **Command Pattern**: GitHub API operations with Copilot validation and retry/rollback
- **Adapter Pattern**: Copilot adapters for different documentation formats and structures
- **Template Method Pattern**: Structured Copilot workflows for consistent scrum processes
- **Facade Pattern**: Simplified interface that orchestrates Copilot and other components

## Configuration-Driven Architecture (Enhanced with Copilot Context)

Instead of hardcoded scripts, use a sophisticated configuration system that provides rich context to Copilot:

```typescript
interface CopilotProjectConfiguration {
  projectType: 'web-application' | 'api-service' | 'mobile-app' | 'library';
  technology: TechnologyStack;
  team: TeamConfiguration;
  sprintLength: number;
  estimationMethod: 'story-points' | 'time-based' | 'complexity';
  workflows: WorkflowConfiguration[];
  
  // Copilot-specific configuration
  copilotSettings: {
    model: 'gpt-4' | 'gpt-3.5-turbo';
    temperature: number; // Creativity level for responses
    systemPrompts: {
      issueGeneration: string;
      sprintPlanning: string;
      retrospectives: string;
      riskAssessment: string;
    };
    contextSettings: {
      includeCodeAnalysis: boolean;
      includeVelocityHistory: boolean;
      includeTechnicalDebt: boolean;
      maxContextLength: number;
    };
  };
}
```

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Create the Copilot integration layer** with proper API interfaces and prompt engineering
2. **Design the Copilot-enhanced object model** with interfaces for AI-powered scrum activities
3. **Set up TypeScript/NestJS foundation** with Copilot service integration
4. **Implement GitHub Projects V2 + Copilot integration** as the foundation
5. **Build a Copilot-powered repository analyzer** that can understand and contextualize projects

The key insight is that **Copilot becomes the "cognitive engine"** that handles all the thinking, writing, and decision-making aspects of being a scrum master, while our design patterns provide the **reliable framework** for consistent execution across different project types and team contexts.
