# Deployment Decision Matrix

## Quick Decision Guide

**Answer these questions to determine your deployment strategy:**

### 1. How many projects will use this scrum master?
- **1-3 projects** â†’ Consider Fork-Per-Project
- **4-10 projects** â†’ Consider Central Orchestration or PR Integration  
- **10+ projects** â†’ Strong recommendation for Central Orchestration

### 2. Who will maintain the scrum master?
- **Individual development teams** â†’ Fork-Per-Project
- **Dedicated DevOps/Platform team** â†’ Central Orchestration
- **Mixed/gradual adoption** â†’ PR Integration

### 3. How important is deep code integration?
- **Very important** (need full codebase context) â†’ Fork-Per-Project
- **Moderately important** â†’ Central Orchestration with rich config
- **Not critical** â†’ PR Integration

### 4. What's your organizational structure?
- **Single team/small org** â†’ Fork-Per-Project
- **Multiple autonomous teams** â†’ PR Integration
- **Enterprise with centralized operations** â†’ Central Orchestration

### 5. How do you prefer to distribute tooling?
- **Everything in one repo** â†’ Fork-Per-Project
- **Package/dependency management** â†’ PR Integration
- **Centralized service approach** â†’ Central Orchestration

## Implementation Roadmap by Strategy

  projects: {
    [projectKey: string]: {
      repository: string;
      projectId: string;
      teamSettings: TeamConfig;
      sprintConfig: SprintConfig;
      copilotSettings: CopilotConfig;
    };
  };
  globalSettings: GlobalConfig;
}
```

#### Phase 2: Project Management (2-3 weeks)
- Multi-project GitHub Actions workflows
- Centralized monitoring dashboard
- Cross-project reporting with Copilot insights

#### Phase 3: Advanced Features (3-4 weeks)
- Cross-project velocity analysis
- Portfolio-level planning with Copilot
- Automated project health scoring

---

### ðŸ”„ If You Chose: Fork-Per-Project

#### Phase 1: Template Creation (1-2 weeks)
```
semi-autonomous-scrum-master-template/
â”œâ”€â”€ .github/workflows/scrum-master.yml
â”œâ”€â”€ scrum-master/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ src/ (Copilot integration)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ scripts/ (our 41+ automation scripts)
â”œâ”€â”€ .scrum-config.yml
â””â”€â”€ setup-scrum-master.sh
```

#### Phase 2: Deep Integration (2-3 weeks)
- Local codebase analysis for Copilot
- Project-specific customization system
- Self-updating mechanisms

#### Phase 3: Team Tools (2-3 weeks)
- Team-specific dashboards
- Local development integration
- Custom workflow templates

---

### ðŸ”€ If You Chose: PR Integration

#### Phase 1: Package Development (2-3 weeks)
```typescript
// NPM package: @copilot/scrum-master
export class ScrumMasterIntegration {
  async setupProject(config: ProjectConfig): Promise<void>;
  async generateSprint(): Promise<SprintResult>;
  async monitorProgress(): Promise<ProgressReport>;
}
```

#### Phase 2: PR Generation System (2-3 weeks)
- Automated PR creation workflows
- Template-based integration files
- Minimal footprint design

#### Phase 3: Distribution & Updates (2-3 weeks)
- Package update mechanisms
- Version management
- Migration assistance tools

## Effort Estimation by Strategy

| Strategy | Initial Setup | Per-Project Setup | Maintenance | Scalability |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Central Orchestration** | 6-8 weeks | 2-4 hours | Low (centralized) | Excellent |
| **Fork-Per-Project** | 4-6 weeks | 1-2 hours | Medium (per fork) | Limited |
| **PR Integration** | 6-8 weeks | 15-30 minutes | Low (package updates) | Good |

## Success Metrics by Strategy
